Kustomize introduces
a template-free way to customize application configuration. This differs significantly from other
configuration management tools, which rely on templates or scripting. It enables users to declare
configuration changes through files that Kubernetes can understand without altering the original YAML
files. This method avoids the pitfalls of templating languages and maintains the declarative nature of
Kubernetes objects.

Kustomize works by using a file called kustomization.yaml , which contains customization instructions.
These instructions can include adding labels and annotations, changing the number of replicas, altering
container images, and more.
